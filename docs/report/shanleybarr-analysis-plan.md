# Pre-Registration of Rpr - Reproduction of Malcomb et al 2014 Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa

Grayson Shanley Barr

Malcomb (2014) original analysis of climate vulnerability in Malawi utilizes an additive model to calculate vulnerability across the country.  

$$
Additive Vulnerability Score = (40 - Adaptive Capacity) + Livelihood Sensitivity + Drought Exposure + Flood Risk
$$

However, this methodology would potentially inflate vulnerability scores for vulnerable populations. 

Furthermore, in a reproduction analysis of Malcomb (2014), I plan to calculate a multiplicative vulnerability score. A multiplicative vulnerability score will be able to have a minimum value of 0 as well as a larger range of values which will assist in identifying more of the most vulnerable households. This method will also be able to identify household vulnerability within a larger range which will assist in comparing relative vulnerability among regions in Malawi. 


$$
Multiplicative Vulnerability Score = (40 - Adaptive Capacity) * (Livelihood Sensitivity) * (Drought Exposure + Flood Risk)
$$

I plan to visualize results by creating two maps visualizing results of a multiplicative vulnerability score. I will compare results from the additive and the multiplicative vulnerability score maps. Differences in the range of values and the map visuals will indicate variations in results based on differences in calculating vulnerability between the methodologies.
